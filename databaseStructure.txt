Our database is rather simple. It consists of two tables; the first, userdata, holds the login data of users. It has three columns: username, email, and password, which all store VARCHARs of length 255.
The second table, cardtable, holds a user's card data. It has five columns: cardmodel, cardrewards, cardbalance, cardlimit, and user. cardmodel, cardrewards, and user are all VARCHARs of length 255,
while cardbalance and cardlimit are ints. The username is stored in this table so that the index page doesn't show the data for all users when displayed in a HTML table.
